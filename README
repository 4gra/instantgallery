instantgallery.py takes a directory full of photos and turns it into a photo
gallery made for the web. Just execute the file with the options you want
to specify and you're done. To publish the gallery, just upload the OUTPUT
directory to any webserver. It's plain HTML, so it works on every server.

You can modify the appearance of the gallery by changing the two CSS files
in the root directory.

instantgallery.py can handle and display EXIF information and is able to try
rotating portrait format photos automatically (by using their EXIF rotate
information combined with their aspect ratio).

By default the photos are ordered by their file names alphabetically but you
can specify a flag to have them sorted chronologically: instantgallery.py then
tries to read there EXIF "OriginalDate" field first and uses Unix' mtime() if
it failes.

instantgallery.py is able to generate galleries in other languages than
English, currently only German is supported. If you add another language
I would be glad to get an email (<raphael@geeksfactory.de>) or just fork
the project on github (<https://github.com/raphaelm/instantgallery>).

Output example (German): http://www.raphaelmichel.de/bilder/capitals/

Note: The default style loads a shiny font from Google's servers using
their font API. This may be a privacy issue from your point of view. In this
case, just change the few lines in index.css and single.css.

usage: instantgallery.py [-h] [--title TITLE] [--language LNG] [--no-exif]
                         [--no-rotate] [--no-sort] [--no-date] [--no-gps]
                         [--sub N] [--hoverscrolling] [-y] [-s]
                         INPUT OUTPUT

Makes a gallery. Now.

positional arguments:
  INPUT                 This is directory with pictures for the gallery.
  OUTPUT                Sets where the gallery should be created.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --title TITLE, -t TITLE
                        Sets the title of the gallery
  --language LNG, -l LNG
                        Sets the language to be used in output files.
                        Available languages: en de
  --no-exif, -e         don't output details from EXIF data
  --no-rotate, -r       Don't try to automatically rotate pictures.
  --no-sort, -c         Do not try to sort the pictures chronologically. (We
                        try first to use EXIF as source for the timestamps,
                        then mtime().)
  --no-date, -d         Prevents instantgallery.py from showing the date and
                        time of the picutres on the index page.
  --no-gps, -g          Don't display GPS data (does only make sense if EXIF
                        is displayed).
  --sub N, -S N         Subdirectory entering depth (0 for staying in the
                        original directory).
  --hoverscrolling      An effect for subdirectories. Was intended to look
                        nicer than it acutally does.
  -y                    Say yes to everything.
  -s                    Skips the generation of thumbnails and similar things.
                        Use this only if you're aware of what you're doing.
